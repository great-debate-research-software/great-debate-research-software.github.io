            <p>The event will be hosted using the Zoom platform. We will use the Q&A features to identify the most interesting topics. Please do not use the chat to post questions to the panelists.</p>
            <p>In case Zoom is not possible for you to attend, a live stream without login will be available on the EGU website of the event. That page also has a chat which we will try monitor. However, since the live stream will have a considerable delay, the interaction won't be as smooth. Thanks for your understanding, and please consider using the question form (above) and the discussion forum (below) to discuss your topics of interest.</p>
